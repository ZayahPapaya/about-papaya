  <h1>A Brief Summary of Me</h1>

          My legal name is Aiden Lang; but as you might've encountered so far in the class, my preferred name is Zayah!
          My
          pronouns are she/her but I understand that it is difficult to remember and use due to my voice. I cannot
          properly
          transition at this time, and this career is meant to be my ticket to do so. Additionally, my family is not
          particularly supportive of the idea.

          I took two years of public high school at Snohomish High, a fantastic school determined to have quality
          students,
          but pulled out to instead finish high school via homeschooling. I do wish I hadn't, and would not recommend
          homeschooling for most others. I do not plan to go to college, but I do plan on devoting to software
          development
          and these trade school-like classes.

          My first job was at a local arcade and game store, Let's Play Arcade, as a general extra hand. I had no
          particular
          role, and instead was set to do whatever was needed. I learned to take apart those arcade machines, which are
          absolute death traps mind you, and maintain them. I learned popular tabletop games: Magic: the Gathering,
          Warhammer 40k, Dungeons and Dragons, and a touch of Pokemon. A large part of my job there was to actively
          encourage people to spend much more money than they'd meant to when they walked through the doors. After all,
          everyone needs more dice.

          The second job I took was at Starbucks as a barista, which has been a much better work environment but is also
          a
          shockingly demanding job. There is rarely a quiet moment, and everything must be done quickly and efficiently
          while also being a pleasant host for the environment Starbucks tries to maintain. Free coffee and lunch,
          however, helped keep me going.

          My favorite D&D classes are: Artificer, Monk, Warlock, and Rogue
          My goals at the moment are simple: Learn quickly, get a grip on my career, and become properly independant.
